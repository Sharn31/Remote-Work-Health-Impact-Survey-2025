# Remote Work Health Impact Survey 
The Post-Pandemic Remote Work Health Impact 2025 dataset provides a comprehensive global snapshot of how different work arrangements—remote, hybrid, and onsite—are influencing employee mental and physical health in the post-COVID era. Collected in June 2025, it encompasses responses from a diverse workforce across industries, regions, job roles, and age groups. The dataset explores key areas such as anxiety, burnout, PTSD, depression, and physical complaints like back pain and eye strain, while also examining work-life balance, social isolation, and salary-health correlations. Combining subjective self-reports with objective metrics like hours worked and salary ranges, this resource equips data scientists, health researchers, HR professionals, and policy-makers with valuable insights to identify risk factors, benchmark wellness across demographics, and inform strategic decisions for healthier work environments.
